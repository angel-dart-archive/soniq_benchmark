# Benchmark Overview (auto-generated at 2017-06-08T09:14:25.754936Z UTC)
*All tests are run for 0:05:00.000000 (300000ms).*
## Framework(s) Tested (4)
  * `dart:io` (reference point, not a framework)
  * `angel`
  * `aqueduct`
  * `shelf`
# Conclusion
These are the fastest frameworks, ordered by how many load simulations they won:
  1. `shelf` (7 win(s))
  2. `angel` (1 win(s))

The following were not fast enough, on average, to win any load simulation.
Here they are, in no particular order:
  * `aqueduct`
